                In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum is common placeholder text used to demonstrate the graphic elements of a 
                document or visual presentation, such as web pages, typography, and graphical layout. It is a form of "greeking".
                Even though using "lorem ipsum" often arouses curiosity due to its resemblance to classical Latin, it is not intended 
                to have meaning. Where text is visible in a document, people tend to focus on the textual content rather than upon overall 
                presentation, so publishers use lorem ipsum when displaying a typeface or design in order to direct the focus to presentation. 
                "Lorem ipsum" also approximates a typical distribution of letters in English.
